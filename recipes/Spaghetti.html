<h2>Description</h2>
<p>This scallop pasta dinner with a creamy sauce is fast and easy. I cook the scallops a bit longer than many chefs, but that gives the dish more flavor and they're still tender and moist. I think you'll agree, the sherry sauce benefits significantly from the longer cook time</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>8 ounces uncooked thick spaghetti</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon vegetable oil</li>
    <li>1 pound bay scallops</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons butter</li>
    <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
    <li>2 teaspoons grated lemon zest</li>
</ul>
